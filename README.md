# Socket-Programming
In this socket programming project, I have created implemented a simple web registration system for USC’s EE and CS department. A student will input their username and password into the client host (client) to access USC’s central web registration server. This server (serverM) will forward this information to the credential server (serverC) to validate this user. After the student is authenticated, the program will ask for a course code within the CS and EE departments and category. In this model, each department server (serverCS and serverEE) will store and output the information of the courses offered and error check invalid queries.
